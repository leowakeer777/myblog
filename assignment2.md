## 1. Website Setup & Tools

This static website was built using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator.  
The theme used is Ananke, which is lightweight and easy to customize.

The site consists of four assignment pages:

- assignment1.md
- assignment2.md
- assignment3.md
- assignment4.md

A custom homepage was created to display only four navigation links (Assignment 1 to Assignment 4), without any extra blog content.  
The homepage was manually configured via `_index.md` and a custom `index.html` layout to hide default post listings.

The output directory was changed from `public/` to `docs/` via the `publishDir = "docs"` setting in `config.toml`, enabling GitHub Pages deployment from the `main` branch.

---

## 2. Git Management Process

Version control was managed using Git with meaningful commits to reflect each step of development.  
The project was tracked using GitHub Desktop and pushed to GitHub.
